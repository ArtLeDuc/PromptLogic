## Project Philosophy
PromptLogic is built on a few core principles:
- Modularity — small, predictable components over monolithic complexity
- Clarity — architecture that’s easy to reason about and teach
- Determinism — behavior that is stable, testable, and intentional
- Ergonomics — workflows that support creators, educators, and performers
- Transparency — no hidden magic, no fragile hacks<br>Contributions that reinforce these principles are strongly preferred.

## Development Setup
PromptLogic is a Windows‑native application built with:
- C#
- WinForms
- WebView2
- A modular overlay and scroll‑engine architecture<br>More detailed setup instructions will be added once the public alpha is released.
If you’re exploring the codebase early, feel free to open a Discussion to talk through architecture or ask questions.
---
## Pull Requests<br>If you want to submit code:
- Open an Issue first to discuss the change
- Keep PRs focused and small
- Follow the existing architectural patterns
- Avoid introducing platform‑fragile hacks
- Document your reasoning when adding or modifying modules<br>Every PR should make the system more predictable, not less.
---
## Testing & Verification<br>Before submitting a PR:
- Test your changes in both Run and Edit modes
- Verify overlay behavior (drag, resize, hit‑testing)
- Confirm scroll‑engine behavior is deterministic
- Ensure UI changes maintain clarity and hierarchy<br>If you’re unsure how to test something, ask in Discussions.
